# Gesture Based Music Controller
**very important notice** Google Chrome has changed its Autoplay policy in April 2018 - very recently. 
According to this new policy, you first need to interact with the system through keyboard I/O. 
This obviously would impede a smooth interaction with LeMusic. However, there is a one-time, nice workaround. 
**workaround to the new policy**: 
In your Google Chrome URL bar, enter the link: chrome://flags/#autoplay-policy
Change **Autoplay policy** to *No User gesture is required*

## User's Manual To Interact with LeMusic 
LeMusic is a music library that runs in your browser. 
You can guide your music experience with your hand gestures!
In other words, you can play/pause, switch and grab songs with your hands in the air. 
Please refer to the figure below for the catalogue of gestures. 


Simply, open index.html in your favorite web browser. 
If you will be using Google Chrome, first consider the above notice and apply the quick setting change. 
You are now ready to use LeMusic. 
Look at the catalogue of gestures and enjoy.
